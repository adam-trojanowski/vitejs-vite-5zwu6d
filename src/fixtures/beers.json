    "beerDescription": "BrewDog’s level of dry-hop to a beer formed with a baseline of 100% pilsner malt – and at under 4.5% ABV – gives you a style that flirts at the edges of several others. Think aromas of fresh cut grass, nettle, white grape, melon, tangerine - with similar flavours leading to a dry, bitter finish.",
