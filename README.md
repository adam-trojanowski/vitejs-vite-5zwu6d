# Front End Development Assessment
## Task Description
In this assessment, you'll be working with a Vue3 application with Typescript and Tailwind.

The application shows a list of beers. Your goal is to connect the application to an external API, load the data in pages and allow sorting of the list. Finally, you'll be asked to make simple style adjustments.

You'll find detailed instructions for each of the requirements below.

### Fetch data from API 
We want to load the data from an external API. Use the provided documentation to fetch the data and display it instead of the static list that's currently displayed.

* API: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2
* Set the page size to 10
* Set page count to 5

### Add sorting by name
We want to provide users with the ability to sort the list. We want to be able to sort it alphabetically by the name of the beer. Sorting should work in both directions (ascending and descending). 

* Add sorting logic
* Support sorting in both directions
* Use the buttons in the Header to trigger sorting

### Style footer
The footer should be sticky, meaning it should always be visible at the bottom of the viewport regardless of the page length.

* Add necessary styling/components
* The footer should be sticky

## Requirements
* Use Vue3, Tailwind and Typescript for this project.
* Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
* Commit your changes at right time.
* You are welcome to use documentations or/and external libraries
* This assessment should take you approximately 30 minutes

### Good luck!
